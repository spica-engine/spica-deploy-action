# Version Control Deploy ðŸš€

> GitHub Action to trigger deployment between Spica instances using version control commands.

## ðŸ§© About

This GitHub Action automates resource deployment between **any Spica instances** using version control capabilities.  
It eliminates the need for manual `curl` commands by offering a configurable, reusable action suitable for various environments.

It performs the following steps:

1. `fetch <remote> <branch>` â€“ Retrieves the latest changes from a versioned source instance.
2. `reset --hard <remote>/<branch>` â€“ Force-applies the changes to the target instance, ensuring a clean sync without merge conflicts.

This setup is ideal for pipelines that deploy between any Spica environments â€” such as development to testing, testing to production, or cross-instance syncing â€” via version-controlled snapshots.
