# Version Control Deploy ðŸš€

> GitHub Action to trigger deployment on a Spica production instance using version control sync commands.

---

## ðŸ§© About

This GitHub Action is used to automate deployment of resources from **staging** to **production** in Spica-based projects via version control.  
It replaces manual `curl` commands by providing a configurable and reusable action with minimal setup.

It performs:

1. `fetch <remote> <branch>` to retrieve the latest changes
2. `reset --hard origin/main` to apply the changes, avoiding conflicts

This flow ensures a clean synchronization with production, ideal for CI pipelines that auto-deploy after merges to `main`.
